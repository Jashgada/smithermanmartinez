        <p class="p-2">The words, "Next Lives Here" are more than just a phrase to me, they are a mantra. A mantra I hold in my heart as I walk throughout campus and during every rendition of the Alma Mater. Our university has accepted the need to embrace constant evolution as that is the sole way to continue to innovation. Although innovation can be seen on campus and throughout UC's history, tradition is still widely admired.

        While venturing out into the Bearcat Community as a first year student, I was amazed at the countless opportunities students had ready for them. Students were able to find their place at the table, make a difference in the surrounding area, and build a skillset that accompanied them to future success. I quickly became interested in the role the Undergraduate Student Government served within the student body and became involved as a member of the Student Government Mentoring Program, Executive Staff, and as a Senator At-Large. Here I learned how I want to make a positive, lasting impact through the guidance of others, dedication for the betterment of all, and the knowledge that a student's voice is the most powerful voice on a college campus.
            <br><br>
            I, still a growing leader, have dug deep to educate myself and learn more of the perspectives students with differing identities than mine hold and am determined to continue this self work. I ask that through this journey, you join us in keeping each other accountable and willing to listen to one another. As potentially the first women slate at UC to be elected, Taylor and I both know that we must lay a foundation that sets forth the notion that we may be the first, but we will not be the last. That anyone who looks to a position questioning if they should even dream about holding it, know that they have all the right to do so.
            <br> <br>
            Together We Will complete worthwhile initiatives for a greener, sustainably enriched campus. Together We Will strive to make a difference in the lives of each student, community member, and faculty member through increased focus on resources and needs. Together We Will be better and amplify each other's voices so that they are heard, seen, and valued. Together We Will empower women to run and make history on UC's campus. I am running to be your next Student Body President because I know that Together We Will never settle, push past barriers, and truly exhibit that Next Lives Here.</p>

 <p>Venturing into my first year at the University of Cincinnati in the fall of 2019 was life-changing for me. I would constantly reflect on my hometown roots and the privilege I hold as one of the few from my high school class to attend a four-year university. Because of this reason, I promised myself that if awarded the opportunity to attend college, I would make the most out of my four years and create a lasting impact wherever I decided to go.

    I am honored to be Bearcat and call Cincinnati my home. I laugh when I tell the story about how I committed to UC before I had even toured the campus because I just knew it was for me -- I couldn’t have been more right in my assumption. Both freshman orientation and being accepted into the Darwin T. Turner Scholarship Program set the stage for how transformative the next four years would be for me. During September of my first year, Student Government immediately caught my eye as an empowering organization which gave students the platform to create large-scale change. I began to learn more about the inner workings of SG through the Student Government Mentorship Program where I met inspiring student leaders who encouraged me to take on the role of Secretary of Senate. Throughout that first year, those mentors strengthened  my courage during that semester, as I planned my Senator-At-Large campaign for the spring. That campaign taught me the tremendous advantages of building a team, collaborating with people around campus, and taking everyone’s voice into account. Among my various campus involvements, Student Government has remained a constant for me; It aligns strongly with the work I hope to continue in my future career and allows me the platform and resources to advocate for a large body of students, especially marginalized students like myself.

	I recognize that I will always have growing to do as a student-leader, but I look forward to showing you all that April and I are passionate individuals with the same goal of uplifting the voices of the student body through countless initiatives and ideas. It is still surreal to think that April and I could potentially make history as the first all-women slate to win an election in UC’s history, but I believe the real history will be made with how we execute our terms and advocate for the student body more than ever before. I am a firm believer that how you campaign is how you lead; April and I have been intentional with our decision to lead a campaign based on love, unity, and empowerment, and Together We Will make sure we lead the student body the same exact way.
